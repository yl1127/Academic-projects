**Is it still possible to limit warming to 1.5°C?**

Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is a challenging but still feasible goal, according to the IPCC AR6 WGI report. The document outlines various measures and strategies that need to be adopted to achieve this target:

1. **Educating and Mobilizing People**: Education and knowledge transfer are crucial for empowering individuals to take action in their respective roles. Citizens can exert political pressure, professionals can change standards in line with decarbonization, and investors can shift funds from fossil fuels to carbon-neutral technologies【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 585】.

2. **Rapid and Deep Reductions in Emissions**: Limiting warming to 1.5°C requires rapid and profound reductions in energy system CO2 and GHG emissions. By 2030, in scenarios targeting this goal, net CO2 and GHG emissions are expected to fall by 35–51% and 38–52%, respectively. Achieving this target will necessitate substantial changes in the energy system over the next three decades【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 102】.

3. **Scenarios and Pathways**: Several pathways demonstrate how to limit global warming to 1.5°C with limited overshoot. These pathways involve achieving 50% CO2 reductions by the 2030s relative to 2019 levels and further reducing emissions to reach net zero CO2 emissions in the 2050s【IPCC AR6 WGI, pages 312, 341, 342】.

4. **Challenges and Risks**: The likelihood of limiting warming to 1.5°C with limited overshoot has declined due to the rise in GHG emissions since 2017. Immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors are necessary to keep this goal within reach【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 7】.

5. **Net Negative Emissions**: In some scenarios, achieving the 1.5°C target will require deploying net negative CO2 emissions in the second half of the century. The amount of net negative CO2 emissions varies widely across pathways【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 367】.

6. **Sectoral Changes**: Mitigation pathways entail substantial changes in sectors like buildings, industry, transport, and energy supply. This includes reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing production from renewable sources【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 698】.

7. **International Agreements and Mobilization**: The release of IPCC reports, like the one on limiting warming to 1.5°C, has led to a renewed urgency in climate mitigation efforts and has influenced transnational climate mobilization【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1469】.

In summary, while it is still possible to limit global warming to 1.5°C, it requires immediate, widespread, and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. The window for achieving this goal is rapidly closing, and concerted global action is necessary.

**When will we reach 1.5°C?**

The specific timing of when we will reach a global warming of 1.5°C is not straightforwardly pinpointed in the IPCC AR6 WGI report. However, it provides important insights regarding the likelihood and conditions under which this warming level might be reached:

1. **Scenarios and Likelihood**: The report mentions scenarios where there is a likelihood of more than 67% of reaching or exceeding 1.5°C during the 21st century. In scenarios aiming to limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, the warming might be limited to 1.5°C by 2100 with a likelihood of more than 50%【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1899】.

2. **Emissions Pathways**: Pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot involve substantial reductions in CO2 and GHG emissions. If Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are fully implemented, and depending on the level of ambition in the updated NDCs, the prospects for staying below 2°C could be enhanced, although limiting warming to 1.5°C would still be challenging【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 169】【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1798】.

3. **Overshoot and Reversal**: Some scenarios consider the possibility of temporarily exceeding 1.5°C (overshoot) and then bringing temperatures down by 2100 through net negative emissions. The degree of overshoot and the duration over which it occurs can vary【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 367】.

4. **Carbon Budget and Emission Reductions**: The remaining carbon budget and the rate of emission reductions are critical factors. Immediate and significant reductions in emissions are necessary to keep the 1.5°C target within reach. The more CO2 emitted until 2030, the less can be emitted thereafter to stay within this budget【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 362】.

5. **Net Zero Emissions**: Scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot reach a point of net zero CO2 emissions after 2050. The exact timing of reaching net zero CO2 can show some variation depending on the reduction profile and non-CO2 emissions【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 340】.

In summary, while the report does not provide a precise year for reaching 1.5°C, it emphasizes the critical importance of immediate and significant reductions in GHG emissions to maintain the possibility of limiting global warming to this level. The likelihood and timing of reaching 1.5°C are contingent on the trajectories of global emissions in the coming decades.

**What does overshoot mean?**

In the context of climate change, "overshoot" refers to a situation where the global average temperature temporarily exceeds a specific target level before eventually returning to or falling below that level. The concept of overshoot is frequently discussed in climate models and emission scenarios, especially those targeting limits on global warming, such as the 1.5°C target set by the Paris Agreement.

There are two types of overshoot mentioned in the IPCC AR6 WGI report:

1. **Limited Overshoot**: This refers to scenarios where global warming exceeds the target level (e.g., 1.5°C) by a small margin (up to about 0.1°C) and for a limited period, typically up to several decades. After this temporary exceedance, global temperatures are brought back down to the target level【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1899】.

2. **High Overshoot**: In these scenarios, the global average temperature exceeds the target level by a larger margin (0.1°C–0.3°C) and also for a longer period. Similar to limited overshoot scenarios, temperatures are eventually reduced to the target level, but the initial exceedance is more significant【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 320】【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 340】.

Overshoot scenarios often depend on the deployment of net negative emissions technologies and strategies later in the century to bring temperatures back down. These scenarios imply increased climate-related risks compared to pathways that limit warming without overshoot. The feasibility and implications of these overshoot scenarios are subjects of ongoing research and debate in the climate science community【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 367】【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 28】.

**Can we avoid overshooting 1.5°C?**

Avoiding the overshoot of the 1.5°C warming threshold is a complex and challenging goal. The IPCC AR6 WGI report provides insights into the feasibility and requirements to achieve this:

1. **Rapid and Deep Emission Reductions**: Limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot requires rapid and deep reductions in energy system CO2 and GHG emissions. By 2050, net energy system CO2 emissions need to fall by 87–97% compared to current levels. In scenarios limiting warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, net CO2 and GHG emissions must fall by 35–51% and 38–52%, respectively, by 2030【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 102】.

2. **Challenges and Feasibility Concerns**: Overshoot pathways imply increased climate-related risk and are subject to increased feasibility concerns. The report notes that projected global GHG emissions from Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) announced prior to COP26 would likely result in warming exceeding 1.5°C, making it harder to limit warming below this threshold after 2030【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 28】.

3. **Pathways to Limit Warming**: Many pathways in the literature show how to limit global warming to 1.5°C with limited overshoot compared to pre-industrial levels. However, the likelihood of achieving this has decreased since global GHG emissions have risen since 2017, leading to higher near-term emissions and higher cumulative CO2 emissions until the time of net zero【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 90】.

4. **Sectoral Changes and Actions**: Mitigating actions relative to non-CO2 emissions become important, especially in developing countries where the share of non-CO2 emissions is high. Achieving the 1.5°C target requires substantial changes in sectors like energy, land, urban infrastructure, transport, and buildings【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 448】.

5. **Global Cooperation and Policy Measures**: Effective international cooperation and strong policy measures are necessary to achieve the ambitious goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C without overshoot. This includes transitioning to low-carbon alternatives and avoiding lock-in to fossil fuel-intensive production systems【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 411】.

In summary, while it is technically possible to limit warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, it would require immediate, extensive, and unprecedented global efforts in reducing GHG emissions across all sectors. The success of this endeavor hinges on strong international collaboration and the implementation of ambitious and effective climate policies.

**Have emissions reductions fallen for some countries?**

Yes, emissions reductions have fallen for some countries. The IPCC AR6 WGI report provides several insights on this topic:

1. **Reduction by Some Countries**: A growing number of countries have reduced their CO2 and GHG emissions for longer than 10 years. About 24 countries have shown a reduction in territorial CO2 and GHG emissions as well as consumption-based CO2 emissions for at least 10 years. However, uncertainties in emissions levels and changes over time prevent a precise assessment of reductions in some cases【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 249】.

2. **Impact of Climate and Non-climate Policies**: The reductions achieved by some countries have been driven by both climate and non-climate policies and factors, including structural changes. Most territorial emissions reductions were realized in the electricity and heat sector, followed by industry and buildings, while transport emissions have increased in many cases【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 249】.

3. **Decoupling Emissions from Economic Growth**: In the period from 2010 to 2015, 43 out of 166 countries achieved absolute decoupling of consumption-based CO2 emissions from economic growth. This means these countries experienced GDP growth while their emissions stabilized or declined. This group includes both developed and developing countries【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 287】.

4. **Emissions Reductions Amidst Global Emissions Growth**: The combined emissions reductions achieved by some countries have been outweighed by rapid emissions growth elsewhere, especially among developing countries. The per-capita emissions of developed countries remain high, particularly in countries like Australia, Canada, and the United States of America【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 70】.

5. **Kyoto Protocol's Impact**: Studies suggest that participation in the Kyoto Protocol led to substantial reductions in national GHG emissions and increased levels of innovation and investment in low-carbon technologies【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1493】.

6. **Varied Performance of Carbon Pricing**: The performance of carbon pricing varies by country and sector. For example, the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has reduced emissions, though the estimates vary by study, country, and sector【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 283】.

7. **Overall Emission Trends**: Global annual emission growth has slowed, as evidenced by smaller annual emission increments between 2011 and 2019 compared to 2000 and 2008【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1494】.

In summary, while some countries have successfully reduced their emissions, these reductions are often offset by increases in other regions, particularly in developing countries with lower base levels of per-capita emissions. The overall global emissions trajectory is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, including economic growth, policy measures, and structural changes in various sectors.

**What is the best estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity?**

The best estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) is not explicitly stated in the provided sections of the IPCC AR6 WGI report. Equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the long-term change in global average surface temperature following a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration compared to pre-industrial levels. 

The report discusses various aspects of climate response, climate projections, and mitigation pathways, but a specific 'best estimate' value for ECS is not directly provided in the cited sections. The ECS is a crucial metric in climate science as it helps predict the Earth's temperature response to increased levels of greenhouse gases. However, determining an exact 'best estimate' can be complex due to uncertainties in climate feedbacks and other factors.

For detailed information on the ECS as assessed in the IPCC AR6 report, it would be necessary to refer to the full context of the report, particularly sections that focus on climate models and sensitivity analyses.

**Is it possible the Arctic will become ice free at some points before 2050?**

The IPCC AR6 WGI report does not provide a definitive prediction about the Arctic becoming completely ice-free before 2050. However, it discusses the significant reductions in Arctic sea ice and the potential implications of these changes.

1. **Reduction in Arctic Sea Ice**: The report acknowledges the ongoing and significant reduction in Arctic sea ice, which has implications for regional and global climate patterns, including changes in albedo (reflectivity) and amplification of warming【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1107】.

2. **Climate Models and Projections**: Although specific projections about the Arctic becoming ice-free are not detailed in the provided sections, climate models generally show that Arctic sea ice is decreasing and could reach extremely low levels in the coming decades. This is influenced by factors such as global temperature rise and changes in atmospheric composition.

3. **Uncertainties in Predictions**: There are uncertainties in predicting the exact timing of when the Arctic might become ice-free. These uncertainties stem from variations in climate models, natural variability in the climate system, and future greenhouse gas emission trajectories.

4. **Implications of Reduced Sea Ice**: The report discusses the broader implications of reduced Arctic sea ice, such as potential changes in shipping routes and impacts on local ecosystems and communities【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1107】.

In summary, while the IPCC AR6 WGI report discusses the ongoing reduction in Arctic sea ice and its potential impacts, it does not provide a specific prediction or confirmation about the Arctic becoming ice-free before 2050. This topic is subject to ongoing research and is influenced by a range of environmental, climatic, and human factors.

**How likely will the world see runaway ice loss from the Antarctic  ice sheets by 2100?**

The likelihood of a "runaway" ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheets by 2100 is not specifically quantified in the sections of the IPCC AR6 WGI report that were searched. However, the report discusses several aspects related to ice loss and its impacts:

1. **General Trends in Ice Loss**: The report acknowledges significant changes in the cryosphere, including declining Arctic sea ice and glaciers, which are part of the broader patterns of climate change and global warming【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 170】.

2. **Impact of Emission Pathways**: The likelihood and extent of ice loss are closely related to future greenhouse gas emission pathways. Higher emissions scenarios result in more significant warming and, consequently, greater potential for ice loss【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 311】.

3. **Uncertainties and Risks**: The report mentions that overshoot pathways, where temperature temporarily exceeds targets like 1.5°C or 2°C before reducing, imply increased climate-related risks, including impacts on ice sheets【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 367】.

4. **Sea Level Rise Considerations**: While not directly about "runaway" ice loss, the report discusses the long-term implications of melting ice, including sea level rise, which can continue for decades to millennia【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 367】.

5. **Need for More Research**: The report suggests that more research is needed to understand the full implications of various emission scenarios on ice loss and other climate change impacts.

In summary, while the IPCC AR6 WGI report does not provide a specific probability of runaway ice loss from the Antarctic ice sheets by 2100, it emphasizes the importance of emission pathways in determining the extent of ice loss and associated risks like sea level rise. The report highlights the ongoing and anticipated impacts of global warming on the cryosphere but suggests that more detailed studies are needed to fully understand these dynamics.

**To what extent has climate change impacted ice sheets in both polar regions?**

The IPCC AR6 WGI report provides significant insights into the impact of climate change on ice sheets in both polar regions:

1. **Decline in Arctic Sea Ice**: The report highlights a clear decline in Arctic sea ice, which has implications for regional and global climate patterns. The reduction of sea ice in the Arctic leads to lower surface albedo, amplifying climate warming. Additionally, local air pollutants, like black carbon emissions, can reduce albedo and absorb heat, further contributing to ice loss【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1107】.

2. **Increased Shipping Routes**: The melting of Arctic sea ice has led to more navigable Arctic waters, impacting shipping routes and potentially leading to changes in emission patterns from shipping activities【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1107】.

3. **Comprehensive Changes Beyond Temperature**: Aside from temperature increases, human-induced changes have resulted in declines in Arctic sea ice and glaciers, among other global changes【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 170】.

4. **Regional Impacts of Climate Change**: The impacts of climate change, including on ice sheets, are complex and can vary geographically, with significant regional differences【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 348】.

5. **Climate Change and Mitigation Potential**: While the report does not provide a direct quantification of the impact of climate change on Antarctic ice sheets, it discusses the broader implications of climate change on mitigation potential, including effects on carbon budgets and feedbacks【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 348】.

6. **Biophysical Effects of Climate Change**: Changes in land conditions, including those due to climate change, have significant biophysical effects, which could impact ice sheets indirectly through changes in the global climate system【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 779】.

In summary, the IPCC AR6 WGI report indicates that climate change has significantly impacted ice sheets in the Arctic region, primarily through the reduction of sea ice and associated climate feedbacks. The report also discusses the broader implications of climate change, which could indirectly affect ice sheets in both polar regions, though specific details about the Antarctic ice sheets are less directly addressed in the cited sections.

**Will coastal New York see the impact of Greenland ice sheet melting by 2100?**

The IPCC AR6 WGI report does not specifically address the impact of Greenland ice sheet melting on coastal New York by 2100 in the sections that were searched. However, it discusses several relevant factors related to climate change, ice melt, and sea-level rise:

1. **Global Sea-Level Rise**: Melting of polar ice sheets, including Greenland, contributes to global sea-level rise. This rise can significantly impact coastal regions worldwide, including cities like New York【IPCC AR6 WGI, pages various】.

2. **Increased Risks from Climate Change**: The report highlights increased risks from climate change, including those related to water resources, hydro-climatic patterns, and impacts on coastal areas【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1765】.

3. **Arctic Cryosphere Melt and Shipping Routes**: While not directly related to New York, the report mentions that the melting of the Arctic cryosphere affects shipping routes and could have broader climatic impacts【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1107】.

4. **Implications for Urban Areas**: Urban areas, such as New York, are likely to be affected by various aspects of climate change, including increased heat and potential impacts on infrastructure and services【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 890】.

In summary, while the report does not provide a direct analysis of the impact of Greenland ice sheet melting on coastal New York by 2100, it underscores the broader risks associated with sea-level rise and climate change, which are relevant to coastal urban areas. The melting of ice sheets, including Greenland, contributes to sea-level rise, posing potential risks to coastal cities worldwide.

**What will be the likely changes to weather and climate extremes in coastal New York around 2050 if the world take no action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?**

The IPCC AR6 WGI report does not provide a specific forecast for weather and climate extremes in coastal New York around 2050 in the absence of greenhouse gas emission reductions. However, it discusses several related aspects of climate change that could impact regions like coastal New York:

1. **Increased Frequency and Severity of Hot Extremes**: The report notes that both the frequency and severity of hot extremes have increased in recent decades, suggesting that this trend may continue or intensify without emission reductions【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 170】.

2. **Intensification of Heavy Precipitation**: Alongside increasing hot extremes, there has been an intensification of heavy precipitation, which could be relevant for coastal regions prone to flooding【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 170】.

3. **Global Sea-Level Rise**: Rising sea levels, driven by melting ice and thermal expansion of the oceans, could impact coastal cities like New York, particularly in high-emissions scenarios【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 170】.

4. **Urban Heat Island Effect**: Urban areas are expected to experience more extreme warming compared to their rural surroundings, with nighttime warming being particularly pronounced. This is of relevance to densely populated urban areas like New York【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 903】.

5. **Changes in Water Resources and Hydrological Extremes**: Climate change is projected to impact the distribution and variability of global water resources, which could affect water availability and flood risks in coastal areas【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1764】.

6. **Changes in Energy Demands and System Infrastructure**: The effects of climate change on energy demands and infrastructure, including increased cooling demands, are relevant for urban centers like New York【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 682】.

In summary, while the report does not provide specific projections for coastal New York in 2050 without emission reductions, it suggests that such a scenario could lead to more frequent and severe hot extremes, intensified precipitation, higher risks of sea-level rise, and increased urban heat effects. These changes could have significant implications for urban infrastructure, water resources, and the overall livability of coastal areas.

**What are the primary evidence and how robust is it that human activities caused the observed global warming since the pre-industrial period?**

The IPCC AR6 WGI report provides robust evidence that human activities have been the primary cause of observed global warming since the pre-industrial period. This conclusion is supported by multiple lines of evidence:

1. **Rise in Greenhouse Gas Emissions**: The report states that greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade are at the highest levels in human history, driven mainly by continued fossil fuels use. These emissions have been directly linked to global warming【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 7】.

2. **Human-Induced Changes Beyond Natural Variations**: Human activities have led to clearly discernible changes beyond natural variations, including declines in Arctic sea ice and glaciers, thawing of permafrost, and a strengthening of the global water cycle. These changes are consistent with the expected impacts of increased greenhouse gas concentrations【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 170】.

3. **Attribution Analysis**: The report includes attribution analyses that show the impact of human activities on climate change. These analyses demonstrate that human-induced emissions and activities have significantly contributed to the observed warming trends【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1492】.

4. **Relationship Between Cumulative CO2 Emissions and Global Warming**: The report reaffirms a near-linear relationship between cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions and global warming, supporting the conclusion that human activities are the main driver of the observed climate change【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 444】.

5. **Increased Frequency and Severity of Climate Extremes**: There has been an increased occurrence of weather conditions that promote wildfires and an intensification of heavy precipitation. These changes are consistent with the impacts of human-induced global warming【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 170】.

In summary, the evidence presented in the IPCC AR6 WGI report is robust and multi-faceted, strongly supporting the conclusion that human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels and the resultant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, have been the primary cause of the observed global warming since the pre-industrial period.


**What are the issues with financing adaptation?**

The IPCC AR6 WGI report outlines several issues associated with financing adaptation to climate change. These issues highlight the complexities and challenges in mobilizing and effectively using financial resources for adaptation measures. Key issues include:

1. **Skepticism about Private Sector Involvement**: There is skepticism regarding private sector involvement in adaptation due to factors like the lack of resilience-related revenue streams, small scale of some adaptation projects, and the overall 'intangibility' of financing adaptation projects【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1592】.

2. **Limited and Unpredictable Financing**: Financing for resilience is often limited, unpredictable, fragmented, and focused on a few projects or sectors. It tends to be short-term rather than programmatic and long-term, which is essential for building resilience【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1592】.

3. **Discrepancies in Public and Private Funding**: While there are market-based mechanisms for resilience financing, they are not equally accessible to all developing countries. Moreover, reliance on grants and concessional loans can undermine debt sustainability【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1592】.

4. **Adaptation Financing a Small Share of Green Bond Financing**: Adaptation financing constitutes only about 2% of the share of green bond financing raised, indicating that it is a relatively small component of overall climate finance【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1592】.

5. **Rising Adaptation Financing Needs**: Adaptation financing needs are rising rapidly, particularly in developing countries. The current efforts are insufficient to narrow the adaptation finance gap, and additional adaptation finance is necessary【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1568】.

6. **Complexity in Measuring and Reporting Finance for Adaptation**: There is difficulty in identifying relevant activities within financial datasets for adaptation, leading to fragmented and significantly lower finance than the rapidly rising needs【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1577】.

7. **Barriers to Redirecting Capital to Climate Action**: There are barriers within and outside the financial sector to redirect capital towards climate action, including inadequate assessment of climate-related risks and investment opportunities, regional mismatches, and country-specific factors【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 60】.

8. **Challenges in Attracting Financing in Developing Countries**: Developing countries face challenges in attracting financing due to requirements for adaptation, reduction of losses and damages, infrastructure needs, and capacity building【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 60】.

These issues point to the need for improved approaches to mobilizing and deploying finance for climate adaptation, with an emphasis on addressing the unique challenges faced by developing countries and the need for long-term, sustainable financing solutions.

**Where is the majority of climate finance going?**

The majority of climate finance is heavily focused on mitigation activities, with a significant portion of funding directed towards developed countries and a few large economies. Key insights from the IPCC AR6 WGI report regarding the distribution of climate finance include:

1. **Focus on Mitigation**: Over 90% of climate finance between 2017 and 2020 has been focused on mitigation efforts【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 146】【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1562】.

2. **Concentration in Few Economies**: Climate finance in developing countries is heavily concentrated in a few large economies, such as Brazil, India, China, and South Africa, which collectively account for a significant share of climate finance【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1577】.

3. **Private Sector Dominance**: At a global level, the majority of tracked climate finance comes from private actors, though the boundaries between private and public finance are not always clear【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1577】.

4. **Domestic Sourcing**: The vast majority of tracked climate finance is sourced from domestic or national markets rather than cross-border financing. This emphasizes the importance of national policies and the development of local capital markets【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1577】.

5. **Limited Financing for Adaptation**: Despite the strong economic rationale for adaptation action, more than 90% of financing is allocated to mitigation activities, leaving adaptation significantly underfunded【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1623】.

6. **Public and Private Fossil Fuel Financing Concerns**: Persistently high levels of both public and private fossil fuel-related financing continue to be a major concern, reflecting policy misalignment and the current perceived risk-return profile of fossil fuel-related investments【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1623】.

7. **Disparities in Financing Distribution**: Least-developed countries (LDCs) continue to represent less than 5% of the total climate finance year-on-year, highlighting disparities in the distribution of funding【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1577】.

8. **Commercial Financing for Mitigation and Adaptation**: In 2017 and 2018, about 75% of global climate finance for both mitigation and adaptation took the form of commercial financing (e.g., balance sheets, commercial-rate loans, equity)【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 928】.

In summary, climate finance is predominantly directed towards mitigation activities and is mainly sourced from private actors and domestic markets. Developing countries, particularly LDCs, receive a smaller share of climate finance, indicating a need for more balanced and equitable distribution of funds.

**What are the options for scaling up adaptation and mitigation in developing countries?**

**Which regions will be disproportionally affected by climate change?**

The majority of climate finance is predominantly directed towards mitigation activities, with a significant portion concentrated in a few large economies and developed countries. Key insights from the IPCC AR6 WGI report regarding the distribution of climate finance include:

1. **Focus on Mitigation**: Over 90% of global climate finance between 2017 and 2020 was allocated to mitigation activities. This emphasis on mitigation reflects the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 147】.

2. **Private Sector Dominance**: The majority of climate finance is assessed as coming from private actors, although the distinction between private and public finance often includes significant gray areas【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1577】.

3. **Geographical Concentration**: Climate finance in developing countries is heavily concentrated in a few large economies, such as Brazil, India, China, and South Africa. These countries account for a substantial share of climate finance, similar to that represented by developed countries【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1577】.

4. **Limited Funding for Least-Developed Countries**: Least-developed countries (LDCs) continue to represent a small fraction (less than 5%) of the year-on-year climate finance, highlighting an uneven distribution of funds【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1577】.

5. **Domestic Sourcing of Finance**: The vast majority of tracked climate finance is sourced from domestic or national markets rather than cross-border financing. This indicates the crucial role of national policies and settings in mobilizing climate finance【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1577】.

6. **Commercial Financing**: About 75% of global climate finance for both mitigation and adaptation in 2017 and 2018 took the form of commercial financing, such as commercial-rate loans and equity【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 928】.

7. **Public and Private Fossil Fuel Financing**: The report raises concerns about persistently high levels of both public and private fossil fuel-related financing, which continue to be a major concern despite recent commitments to reduce them【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1623】.

8. **Insufficient Adaptation Financing**: Despite the significant economic rationale for adaptation action, a major portion of climate finance is allocated to mitigation activities, leaving adaptation significantly underfunded【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1623】.

In summary, climate finance is primarily focused on mitigation activities, with a significant role played by the private sector. The distribution of funds is uneven, with a greater concentration in certain large economies and developed countries, and less allocation towards LDCs and adaptation projects.

**What is climate justice?**

The IPCC AR6 WGI report indicates that certain regions will be disproportionately affected by climate change, experiencing more severe impacts compared to others. Key points from the report include:

1. **Asia Pacific and Oceania**: This region has been particularly impacted by typhoons and flooding, leading to significant economic losses. Countries like China, India, and the Philippines have experienced billions of dollars in losses due to these climate-related extremes【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1607】.

2. **Caribbean**: The Caribbean region, which has historically experienced climate-related losses equivalent to 1% of GDP each year since 1960, is expected to face significant increases in such losses, possibly amounting to upwards of 8% of projected GDP by 2080【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1607】.

3. **Latin America**: Countries in Latin America, such as Argentina, El Salvador, and Guatemala, have suffered severe agricultural losses due to climate-related events, amounting to about USD 6 billion【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1607】.

4. **Variability in Water Availability and Hydrological Extremes**: The impact of climate change on water availability and hydrological extremes varies by region due to differences in the spatial patterns of projected precipitation changes. This implies that certain regions will experience increased water stress and associated impacts【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 387】.

5. **Urban Areas Globally**: Urban systems worldwide are already experiencing devastating impacts due to severe weather events exacerbated by climate change. The global population in locations affected by floods grew significantly between 2000 and 2015【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 890】.

6. **Global South and Developing Countries**: In the Global South, national climate policy tends to give prominence to adaptation based on country vulnerability, climatic risk, and the importance of local/traditional knowledge. This indicates a higher degree of vulnerability and impact in these regions【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1418】.

In summary, regions such as the Asia Pacific, the Caribbean, and Latin America, as well as urban areas and countries in the Global South, are expected to be disproportionately affected by climate change. These regions will likely face increased climate-related risks, including extreme weather events, water stress, and economic losses.

**What is maladaptation?**

Maladaptation refers to actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased vulnerability to climate change, or diminished welfare, now or in the future. Maladaptation is usually an unintended consequence of adaptation efforts. It highlights the complexity of adapting to climate change, where certain actions, though intended to reduce vulnerability or harm, may inadvertently exacerbate the problem or create new issues. Key aspects of maladaptation include:

1. **Increased Exposure to Climate Stressors**: Some adaptation efforts, like certain urban development strategies, may unintentionally increase exposure to climate stressors such as flooding and the urban heat island effect, thereby reducing the adaptive capacity of affected populations【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 889】.

2. **Decreasing Adaptive Capacity**: There are concerns that some mitigation efforts, designed to meet climate targets, may inadvertently diminish the adaptive capacity of urban poor and marginalized groups by increasing costs of urban services or eroding livelihood options【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 889】.

3. **Trade-offs in Adaptation and Mitigation**: The interplay between adaptation and mitigation actions can sometimes lead to maladaptive outcomes, where strategies to cope with climate change impacts may increase energy and material consumption, leading to higher greenhouse gas emissions【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1010】.

4. **Complex Interactions and Unintended Consequences**: Maladaptation often arises from the complex interactions between various factors in climate policy, including power and interests, which can influence decision-making and lead to unintended consequences, especially for vulnerable people【IPCC AR6 WGI, page 1414】.

Maladaptation exemplifies the need for careful consideration of the broader impacts of climate adaptation strategies to ensure that they do not inadvertently worsen climate-related risks or create new vulnerabilities.

**Will glaciers in Scotland melt?**

The IPCC AR6 WGI report does not specifically address the melting of glaciers in Scotland. However, it discusses broader trends in climate change and its impacts on glaciers globally. In general, the report notes that climate change is leading to declines in glaciers worldwide, primarily due to increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.

While the report does not provide detailed information on Scottish glaciers specifically, it can be inferred from the broader patterns of global warming and glacial retreat that glaciers in Scotland, like those in other parts of the world, are likely affected by climate change. This would typically involve a reduction in glacial mass and potentially increased rates of melting.

For specific information about the status and future projections of glaciers in Scotland, regional studies or reports focusing on the local climate and glacial conditions in Scotland would be more informative.
