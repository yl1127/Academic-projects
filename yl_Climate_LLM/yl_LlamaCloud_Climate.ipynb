It acknowledges that some communities are disproportionately affected by climate change and environmental degradation, and seeks to address these inequalities.\n",

      "\n",
      "For example, imagine a species of bird that has evolved to live in a certain type of forest. Over time, the forest may undergo changes due to environmental factors such as climate change, urbanization, or disease, which can lead to the loss of the bird's habitat and food sources. If the bird does not adapt to these changes, it may become maladapted, meaning it will not be able to survive in its original environment.\n",

The warming temperatures caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation have led to increased melting of glacials in Scotland over the past few decades. This is a concern not only for the environment but also for communities that rely on these glaciers for water supplies and other resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a study published in the journal Nature Climate Change, glaciers in Scotland could lose up to 90% of their volume by the end of the century if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise at current rates. This would have significant impacts on the local ecosystems and wildlife, as well as on human communities that depend on these glaciers for water and other resources.\n",

      "However, it's worth noting that the melting of glaciers in Scotland is not a new phenomenon. Glaciers have been retreating and advancing throughout the Earth's history, and the current rate of melting is not unprecedented. However, the speed and scale of the current melting is unusual and is primarily driven by human activities.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Global exposure to water stress is projected to increase with increased warming, but increases will not occur in all regions (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Schewe et al. 2014; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Gosling and Arnell 2016; IPCC 2019a).\n",
      "2. Limiting warming could reduce water-related risks (high confidence) (O’Neill et al. 2017b; Byers et al. 2018; Hurlbert et al. 2019) and the population exposed to increased water stress (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Schewe et al. 2014; Gosling and Arnell 2016; IPCC 2019a).\n",
      "3. The effect of climate change on water depends on the climate model, the hydrological model, and the metric (high confidence) (Hanasaki et al. 2013; Arnell and Lloyd-Hughes 2014; Schewe et al. 2014; Gosling and Arnell 2016; IPCC 2019a).\n",
      "4. The deployment of climate change mitigation options often affects land and water conditions, and ecosystem capacity to support biodiversity and a range of ecosystem services (IPCC 2019a; IPBES 2019) (robust evidence, high agreement).\n",
      "5. Large areas may be utilized for afforestation/reforestation and energy crops in modelled pathways limiting warming to 1.5°C (Rogelj et al. 2018).\n",
      "6. Non-local impacts may occur through GHG fluxes and subsequent changes in radiative transfer, changes in atmospheric chemistry, thermal, moisture, and surface pressure gradients creating horizontal transport (advection) (de Vrese et al. 2016; Davin and de Noblet-Ducoudré 2010) and vertical transport (convection and subsidence) (Devaraju et al. 2018).\n",
      "7. Regional and global biophysical impacts emerge from model simulations (Davin and de Noblet-Ducoudré 2010; de Vrese et al. 2016; Devaraju et al. 2018), especially if the land condition has changed over large areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it is likely that different regions will be disproportionately affected by climate change, depending on factors such as their geographical location, ecological characteristics, and socio-economic context. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to identify which regions will be most severely affected.\n"
